Implement the algorithm mentioned in the "Runner" technique.

For example, suppose you had a linked list 
a1 -> a2 -> ... ->an -> b1 -> b2 -> ... ->bn 
and you wanted to rearrange it into 
a1 -> b1 -> a2 -> b2 -> ... -> an ->bn.
You do not know the length of the linked list 
(but you do know that the length is an even number).
You could have one pointer pi (the fast pointer) move every two elements for every one
move that p2 makes. When pi hits the end of the linked list, p2 will be at the midpoint.
Then, move pi back to the front and begin "weaving" the elements. On each iteration,
p2 selects an element and inserts it after pi
