Replace spaces
Problem description:
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with'%20'. You may assume that
the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional
characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
(Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input:  "Mr John Smith    "
Output: "Mr%20Dohn%20Smith"

My response:
I made two assumptions here:
1. Ignore heading and trailing spaces;
2. Consecutive spaces are treated as a single one.

My method uses a buffer string to help the manipulation, thus it is NOT in-place.
The algorithm provided by the book is in-place and it didn't make the assumptions that I made.
The trick for this in-place algorithm is that it edits the string starting from the end and work backwards.
