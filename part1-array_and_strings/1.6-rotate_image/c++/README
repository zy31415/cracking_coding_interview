1.6 - Image Rotation:
Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is
4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in
place?

Answer:
I implement two methods:
1. Non-recursive method;
2. Recursive method.

In-place: Yes
Time complexity - O(N^2)
Space complexity - O(N^2)
where N is the dimension of the matrix.
